## Usage

After starting the program, it lives in the system tray.
Clicking on the tray icon gives opens a menu with a few different options:

- `Start/Attach to SteamVR`: If the program was opened with SteamVR not running, this option will launch it, or attach it to a running instance that was manually started.
- `Register with SteamVR`: "Installs" the software in SteamVR. This will put it into the list of possible startup overlay apps, so you can have SteamVR launch it automatically.
- `Unregister from SteamVR`: "Uninstalls" the software from SteamVR, so it can no longer be automatically started.
- `Pause`: Will pause/unpause the clipboard copying without closing the app.
- `Exit`
